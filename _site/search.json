In this blog, I‚Äôll add content in English.\nNow that I explained why this blog was created, I‚Äôm going to write about some of the steps that you need to take to create a blog with Quarto.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nA lot of the steps that I explain in this post can be used to create other outputs with Quarto, such as websites, presentations, and books."

This step is called deploy, and we will use a service called Netlify for this purpose.\n\nFirst, Sign up or Log in on Netlify. I recommend signing in using your GitHub account.\nThen, you can click Add new site and Import an existing project:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, you need to connect to a Git provider. In this case, click the link to GitHub. It may ask you to authenticate with GitHub if you have not done this already.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen, in Pick a repository from GitHub, choose the repository that you created for your blog:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis step is really important, so don‚Äôt hurry up and take your time to do it with care! In Import an existing project from a Git repository, you only have to change one thing: the Base directory field. You need to write the name of the directory used to store the HTML files of your blog. By default, it is _site. This is because when you generate your blog, by default Quarto saves all the HTML files generated for your site in the directory called _site. Everything else will be filled out by Netlify, so don‚Äôt change anything else. Check if everything looks like the image below and then click Deploy site:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you first deploy a website on Netlify, it will show an automatic URL. In this case it was peppy-cat-2e067c.netlify.app. You can change it to a more personal URL, which would be easier for other people to type and remember. To change your site URL, click Site settings:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen click Change site name:\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd choose the name used for the URL of your blog, writing it on the field Site name. Below this field, you can see how the URL of your blog is going to look like! After choosing it, click Save. If you need, you can change it after.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow the blog that I am creating as an example is available in this link: https://your-awesome-blog-with-quarto.netlify.app/"

If it is not there, I recommend restarting RStudio and opening your project again.\nThen, in your Git Pane, the list of files with changes will appear. Check the boxes of the files that you want to update, and click Commit:\n Next, you need to write a message that, in a few words, explains what was changed. Write this message in the Commit message field, and the click Commit:\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, close the Git window, then click Push (it is the green up-arrow button on the Git pane).\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter all the changes are sent to GitHub, the Git Pane will be empty, meaning that there are no new changes:\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, wait a minute and then check your blog online!"

You can use whatever suits you best.\nI chose to use Giscus and here I‚Äôll tell you how to set it up!\n\nYour repository needs to be public on GitHub. The default is to be public, it will only be private if you changed it (you can change it back on your repository settings on GitHub).\nInstall the Giscus App. Go to this website and click the Install button:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen, Giscus will ask you in which repositories you would like to give permission to Giscus. You can choose what you prefer. I chose to give access only to the repository that I‚Äôm going to need this service, so I chose Only select repository and pick the repository of the blog.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou have to enable the Discussions in your repository. First, go to your repository, and click Settings:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen, scroll down to the Features sections, and check the box of the Discussions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen the _quarto.yml file and add this code. Remember to update the information of your repo: in this example is beatrizmilz/name-of-your-blog because beatrizmilz is my GitHub account, and name-of-your-blog is the repository of this example blog.\n\n\ncomments:\n  giscus:\n    repo: YOURGITHUBACCOUNT/YOURREPO\n\nRemember to commit all the changes before checking the online version! If you missed that, go back to the end of section 7 and read the collapsed tip.\nNow we have a comments section on the blog! People need to log in with GitHub in order to write a comment or give a reaction:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nWhen we activate the comments, as default they appear in almost every page! You can hide the comments in specific pages by adding comments: false in the YAML headers of *.qmd files that you want to hide."

You can check how I configured this in this file.\nWrite about yourself, so people can get to know you. You can do that in the about.qmd file. There, you can add links to your social media, a photo, and other information about you that you think might be relevant. You can change the template of this page, in the template option. You can check all the templates in the Quarto documentation. In this personal blog, I chose to use trestles.\nWrite blog posts! Your blog posts are stored in the posts/ directory. Each post has to have a folder, and inside this folder you need a index.qmd file. But follow along the template that is already there and you will be good to go. Also, I recommend checking the awesome options described on the Quarto documentation.\nIf you are out of ideas about what to write, my advice is to write something that you already know, want to learn, or something that you like a lot. I enjoy reading blog posts that people write about topics they are interested in!"

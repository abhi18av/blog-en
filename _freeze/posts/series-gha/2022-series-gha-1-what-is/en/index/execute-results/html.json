I did not find examples of using GHA with simple scripts (without the package structure) in the [r-lib/actions repository](https://github.com/r-lib/actions/blob/v2-branch/examples/README.md). So, to do that, we need to get used to how GHA works!\n\nThe [GitHub documentation about workflows](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions) is an excellent source to learn more about this topic.\n\nFirst, the automated process made with GHA is called **Workflow**.\nThe workflow has two main parts: **Events** and **Jobs**.\n\n-   **Events** describe what can start a workflow.\n    For example, an event can be \"start this workflow every day at 9am\", or \"every time someone makes a push into the repository\" (in other words, there is some change in the code).\n\n-   **Jobs** describes what the computer should do.\n    Imagine that it starts with no software installed at all!\n    So we need to write which Operational System (OS) we want our code to run (for example, Ubuntu / Windows/ Mac OS).\n    Also, we need to install R and any packages we need to have to run the code.\n    After that, we can add the script we want to run in R and then save any generated results.\n\nHere is an example of a simple Workflow file.\nThe workflow starts when pressing a button on GitHub (the event), and it installs R and then prints the message \"Hello R World!\" on the console.\n\n``` yml\n# Event - What starts this workflow?\non:\n  workflow_dispatch:\n\n# Name of the workflow\nname: hello-r-world\n\n# Jobs - What the computer should do? \njobs:\n  write-message:\n    # Use Ubuntu   \n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest \n    steps:\n       # Install R\n      - uses: r-lib/actions/setup-r@v3    \n      - name: print-message   \n        # Code to execute R script\n        run: Rscript -e 'print(\"Hello R World!\")' \n```\n\n## See you in the next post!\n\nThis is the general idea of GitHub Actions.\nIn the next post, I'll write how you can create a GHA that runs an R script and saves the result into the GitHub repository. Stay tuned!\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\n- [Daniel Falbel](https://github.com/dfalbel), [Athos Damiani](https://github.com/Athospd), and [Julio Trecenti](https://github.com/jtrecenti):  the people that first introduced me to GitHub Actions and send a bunch of awesome links.

in this case, describe well which groups you are a part of, and point out your contributions to the R community.\n>\n> - The second is about the reduction of the application fee (*fee waiver*) for people from developing countries (*lower-income countries*).\n\n\n## Training\n\nAfter receiving a message of acceptance, it was necessary to indicate one of the possible dates to carry out the training.\nThe training I did was carried out online in two mornings, using Zoom tool.\nThe focus of the training was not about programming in R, but on teaching!\nAll the contents of the slides used are available [at this link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13ohFt3D0EJ5PDbMaWTxnHH-hwA7G0IvY).\n\nMuch of the content presented was similar to the training offered by [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/) (which I described [in this post](https://beatrizmilz.com/posts/2020-02-22- the-carpentries-how-to-do-instructor-training/)), and also with the content of the book written by [Greg Wilson](https://twitter.com/gvwilson), entitled [Teach Tech Together](https://teachtogether.tech/).\n\n\n## Certification exam\n\nAfter completing the training, the next step was to take the teaching  and certification exam (in my case, was about tidyverse).\n[In this link](https://education.rstudio.com/blog/2020/02/instructor-certification-exams/) it is possible to access an example of exams, made available by [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/) for study.\n\nThere was no correct order to take the tests!\nAnother important point is that the tests were done with the screen shared, and we could do a Google search about the topics. But the exam had a time limit, so it's important to pay attention to the time you spend searching!\n\n### Teaching exam\n\nThe teaching exam consisted of a 15-minute demonstration class, and aswering some questions about teaching.\n\nBefore the test itself, it was necessary to send the materials to be used in a demonstration class.\nThe materials I prepared are available on this page: <https://beatrizmilz.github.io/RStudio_Certification/> (and the code is also available in this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/beatrizmilz/RStudio_Certification) .\n\nI created a page for the material using the package [distill](https://rstudio.github.io/distill/) [@R-distill], the presentation made with the package [xaringan](https ://slides.yihui.org/xaringan/) [@R-xaringan], two exercises to do at the end of the class using the package [learnr](https://rstudio.github.io/learnr/) [@ R-learnr], the live code demo was performed using the IDE [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/), and a concept map created with the tool [CMap Tools](https://cmap.ihmc .us/).\nBut these are the tools that *I* chose to use, and I recommend that you use whichever is most comfortable for you!\nThe only mandatory tool to be used in this step is the IDE [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/) (which is easy to understand why...).\n\n\n\n\n###  tidyverse exam\n\nThe tidyverse exam consisted of solving several exercises using R and tidyverse.\nThe recommendation of [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/) to study for this test is to read the book [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/).\n\nI don't have much to say about this step, just practice and use it as much as possible in your daily life and work, so you'll have more experience and be able to solve problems faster during the test.\n\n## Approval!\n\nAfter passing the exams, I received an email with a certificate, and they asked me some information to be added to the list of certified trainers.\nThe page containing my information can be accessed through [this link](https://education.rstudio.com/trainers/people/milz+beatriz/), and the certificate received was this:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Certificate received after completing the'Tidyverse Instructor Certification'.](https://beatrizmilz.com/img/certificado-rstudio.jpg){fig-align='center' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nIn addition, I was also invited to participate in an RStudio Slack channel, where other people that did the training talk about topics related to the training, such as teaching, didactics, R, tidyverse, shiny, among others.\n\nAnd I couldn't miss the celebration either, right?\nDue to the pandemic, the meeting with friends was online.\nThere was also a thank you tweet:\n\n\n<center>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Muito feliz em dizer que sou uma instrutora de <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/tidyverse?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#tidyverse</a> certificada pela RStudio! ðŸŽ‰<br><br>I&#39;m so happy to tell that I&#39;m a certified tidyverse Instructor!<br><br>Thanks <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gvwilson?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@gvwilson</a> and @RStudioEDU for this great oportunity. <a href=\"https://t.co/NL4SeT4mxN\">https://t.co/NL4SeT4mxN</a></p>&mdash; Beatriz Milz (@BeaMilz) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BeaMilz/status/1312129792771125255?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 2, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n\n</center>\n\n## It's the English?\n\nIn my opinion, it is important to have some experience with English, because the training is live and in English.\nI don't know if RStudio has plans to provide training in other languages (like [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/), where there are already some training offerings in Spanish).\n\nThe exams that I did were applied by [Greg Wilson](https://twitter.com/gvwilson) and accompanied by [Daniel Falbel](https://twitter.com/dfalbel) (who is Brazilian, works at RStudio in the development of the [Torch for R](https://torch.mlverse.org/), and is also one of the founding partners of [Curso-R](https://curso-r.com/)).\nDaniel's participation made it possible for me to present the teaching demo entirely in Portuguese, in addition to being able to answer the test questions in Portuguese as well.\nI want to record here my thanks to Greg Wilson for presenting this possibility, and also to Daniel Falbel for agreeing to being part of this process!\nIt was very important for me to feel more relaxed during the test, as I would have to worry less about the language and more about the content of the tests itself.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nFor me, doing this process was a rich experience where I learned and reflected on important content so that I can share more and more quality content about R.\nThat said, I strongly wish that more people from the Latin American community can go through the training process.\n\n\n\n## Acknowledgements ðŸ’œ\n\n\nI already made several acknowledgments throughout the text, but I want to highlight my gratitude to people who were fundamental to this process:\n\n- Team at [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/), [Greg Wilson](https://twitter.com/gvwilson) and [Daniel Falbel](https://twitter.com/dfalbel): thank you for making this training possible!\n\n- [Yanina Saibene](https://twitter.com/yabellini), for showing me the paths to follow!\n\n- It wasn't easy to keep the motivation of studies during the pandemic, but studying in a group helped a lot to continue.\n     So, for the people who studied with me, I really appreciate the moments of study, exchange, support, and help with Spanish as well.\n\n    -   [Riva Quiroga](https://twitter.com/rivaquiroga)\n    -   [Gabriela Sandoval](https://twitter.com/GabySandovalM)\n    -   [Steph Orellana Bello](https://twitter.com/sporella)\n    -   [Silvy Salinas](https://twitter.com/SalinasSilvy)\n    -   [Lucia Rodriguez-Planes](https://twitter.com/_luciarp_)\n    -   [Roxana Noelia](https://twitter.com/data_datum)\n    -   [Patricia Loto](https://twitter.com/patriloto)\n    -   [Ana Laura Diedrichs](https://twitter.com/anadiedrichs)\n    -   [Juliana Benitez](https://twitter.com/July_Benitezs)\n    -   [Javiera Riffo Torres](https://twitter.com/JavieraRiffoTo1)\n\n- My dear friend [Angelica CustÃ³dio](https://twitter.com/angcustodio), for all the support and for believing in me (even when I was afraid of not making it you were there to encourage me to continue studying ` r emo::ji(\"purple_heart\")`).\n\n- People from the communities I participate in and I've learned so much so far: [R-Ladies SÃ£o Paulo](https://twitter.com/RLadiesSaoPaulo), [Curso-R](https://twitter.com/curso_r), [Latin-R](https://twitter.com/LatinR_Conf).\n\n## More useful materials\n\n- Posts on blogs by people who have done the training:\n\n    -   [Yanina Bellini Saibene](https://yabellini.netlify.app/post/rstudiocertification/)\n\n    -   [Silvia CanelÃ³n](https://silvia.rbind.io/2020-10-07-rstudio-instructor-certification-tidyverse/) - I **very** recommend reading it, it features a large list of useful links too!\n\n    -   [Shel Kariuki](https://shelkariuki.netlify.app/blog/certification/)\n\n    -   [Ted Laderas](https://education.rstudio.com/blog/2019/11/my-experience-with-rstudio-instructor-training/)\n\n- [The Carpentries Instructor Training: Suggested Rubric for Teaching Demonstrations](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/demos_rubric/) - This page from The Carpentries presents some examples of points to note for in-class feedback, with positive and negative examples about content and presentation.\n     It's really cool to practice offering the test class and try to do some reflection and self-feedback, using these points as a starting point!\n\n- Articles suggested by [Greg Wilson](https://twitter.com/gvwilson):\n\n    -   [Ten quick tips for creating an effective lesson](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006915)\n\n    -   [Ten quick tips for delivering programming lessons](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007433)\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n:::\n",

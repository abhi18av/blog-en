Hi!
This is the second blog post in the "GitHub Action" Series.
This series of posts are complementary material for my [RStudio Conference - rstudio::conf 2022](https://www.rstudio.com/conference/) lightning talk.

If you have not read the earlier posts in this series, I recommend reading them before continuing on this post:

- [Introduction to GitHub Actions to R users](/posts/series-gha/2022-series-gha-1-what-is/en/) - this post is a good introduction on how GitHub Actions works!

## TL;DR

This post is a tutorial on how to use GitHub Actions with an R script, using GitHub on browser :) We will write a GitHub Action workflow that runs an R script and saves the result into the GitHub repository.

- [ ] Create a GitHub Account

- [ ] Create a repository

- [ ] Create a README.md file (this is optional)

- [ ] Create a R Script

- [ ] Create a file for the workflow

- [ ] Watch your awesome automation run


## Creating your first workflow

### Create a GitHub account

To start using GitHub Actions, first, you need to have an account on [GitHub](https://github.com/).
You can create a new account for free!
You also can sign in to your existing account if you already have one.

### Create a repository

GitHub Actions workflows works with a repository. So, the next step is to create one!

If you don't know what a repository is, imagine having a directory on your computer, and you store files from a project in that directory.
A repository is like that but in the cloud!



To create a repository, on the homepage of GitHub, click on the "+" icon in the top right corner and select [New repository](https://github.com/new).
Give your repository a name, then choose whether you want it to be public or private.
Then click "Create repository".

For this example, I created a repository called [awesome-gha](https://github.com/beatrizmilz/awesome-gha).

### Create a README.md file

Now that we have a repository, we can start creating and adding files to it.
There are different ways you can interact with GitHub: you can clone the repository to your machine and use RStudio Git Pane, for example.
For this post, I will use GitHub in the browser, so even if you are not used to using Git on your machine, it will be possible to follow along.

First, click on "Creating a new file":

Then, add a name for the file: let's create a file called `README.md`.
This file is the first thing people see when accessing your repository, so adding some information about your project is nice.
Then, you can add text and Markdown code in the "Edit new file" section, and finally, click on "Commit new file" to save your changes.

Awesome!
We have a repository and now we can start working on our GitHub Actions.

### Create a R Script

Now we can start creating an R script. For a first GitHub Action, is nice to start with something simple, so we understand what is going on.


```{r}
#| eval: false


```



### Create a file for the workflow

The workflow file is a YAML file that defines when and how the action should run.
This file must be stored in the .github/workflows directory.

### Watch your awesome automation run

## See you in the next post!

This is the general idea of GitHub Actions.

Stay tuned!

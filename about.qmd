Hi!
My name is Beatriz, and I am a R-Lady from Brazil ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡· ðŸ’œ.

I'm a [tidyverse instructor certified by RStudio](https://education.rstudio.com/trainers/people/milz+beatriz/), and I teach R at [Curso-R](https://curso-r.com/).

I have been writing about R in my [blog in Portuguese](https://beatrizmilz.com/blog/) since 2019.
I'm mostly active in the Brazilian R community, co-organizing communities and events, such as: [R-Ladies SÃ£o Paulo](https://twitter.com/RLadiesSaoPaulo), [Latin-R](https://twitter.com/LatinR_Conf), and [satRday SÃ£o Paulo](https://twitter.com/satRdaySP).

I'm a PhD Candidate at the [University of SÃ£o Paulo](http://www.iee.usp.br/).
